# thelyricsapp
An app that allows song-writers to record the melody and flow of their lyrics right next to the lyrics they've written.

Upon launching the app, the user will find themselves at the 'Songs' home page, which displays their library of lyrics, organized by song most recently edited.

Tapping the waveform icon in the top right corner of the 'Songs' home page will allow for the creation of a new song and take the user to the view that allows them to begin writing their lyrics.
Next to each line of lyrics is an unfilled record button. Tapping the record button allows the user to record the melody that accompanies the corresponding line of lyrics.

Once the user has recorded their melody, tapping the record button again will stop the recording. The record button will then turn into a play button so that the user can play back their melody.
A delete button will also appear alongside the play button in case the user desires to delete their recording for any reason.

Toggling the switch at the top of the lyrics screen will hide the record, play and delete buttons if the user prefers to have them hidden at any given point.
